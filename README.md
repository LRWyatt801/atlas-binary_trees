# Binary Trees

In this repository I will be practicing the concepts of binary trees. With a goal to learn:

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference vetween a binary tree and a binary search tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, and the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, and a balanced binary tree
